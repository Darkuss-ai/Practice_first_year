 My work is focused on working with devices that measure temperature, pressure and humidity.

It is necessary to take data from the university server and process it in such a way that it is possible to build graphs and evaluate the operation of the devices themselves: checking for failures, abnormal readings and comparing data with real readings.


main.py - code file.

.csv and .json files - indications of the devices.
